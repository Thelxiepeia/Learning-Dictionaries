# Learning-Dictionaries
Dictionaries of ~1,000 common words. Currently there is only one. The three file types are Case CATalyst's native dictionary file (SGDCT), Case CAT's rich-text export (RTF), and a Plover-generated JSON.

I plan to add two more: a canonical Realwrite/Realtime theory version using my textbook and an "Anoka style" version that reflects exactly what I learned in my theory classes at school. However, the tweaks we made in theory class incorporated group discussions as well, so one group's fresh-from-theory dictionary would be different from another group's.

## ElizabethGrace_1000MostCommonWords
This dictionary reflects my personal writing, which reflects Realwrite/Realtime theory as taught at Anoka Tech in 2019.

The dictionary is 1,000 words from a random list of 1,000 common words I found. Some words have multiple entries because I truly write it multiple ways without hesitating on any of them. I don't know why this happens.

My writing evolves all the time. I may upload new versions of this dictionary for comparison's sake!

# Non-learning Dictionaries
Dictionaries that will not help you learn much.

## Elizabeth-Grace-plover-matches.json
This dictionary is comprised of any entries in my personal dictionary that match an entry in the Plover default dictionary. This was done just because I have some stuff in my personal dictionary that I figured would not be wanted by anyone and could pose a privacy risk if shared, such as full names of attorneys.

This was made possible by the Plover user I know as Rice! They made a very handy script for separating out those entries: https://github.com/RAOEUS/plover-theory-matches
