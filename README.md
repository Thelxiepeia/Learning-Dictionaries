# Learning-Dictionaries
Dictionaries of ~1,000 common words. Currently there is only one.

I plan to add two more: a canonical Realwrite/Realtime theory version using my textbook and an "Anoka style" version that reflects exactly what I learned in my theory classes at school. However, the tweaks we made in theory class incorporated group discussions as well, so one group's fresh-from-theory dictionary would be different from another group's.
