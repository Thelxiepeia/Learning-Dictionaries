# Learning-Dictionaries
Dictionaries of ~1,000 common words. Currently there is only one.

I plan to add two more: a canonical Realwrite/Realtime theory version using my textbook and an "Anoka style" version that reflects exactly what I learned in my theory classes at school. However, the tweaks we made in theory class incorporated group discussions as well, so one group's fresh-from-theory dictionary would be different from another group's.

## ElizabethGrace_1000MostCommonWords
This dictionary reflects my personal writing, which reflects Realwrite/Realtime theory as taught at Anoka Tech in 2019.

The dictionary is 1,000 words from a random list of 1,000 common words I found. Some words have multiple entries because I truly write it multiple ways without hesitating on any of them. I don't know why this happens.

My writing evolves all the time. I may upload new versions of this dictionary for comparison's sake!
